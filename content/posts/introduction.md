I figured since it was best to start off with a bit of an introduction post.
As far as the internet goes, I've been around since the first incantation of 
a blog was using `finger(1)`.

I've been a software developer for nearly 30 years, mostly working at startups.
Most notably, I joined the team at Coinbase in early 2017 and stayed through 
late-2021, after their IPO. This afforded me the opportunity to explore some
other career options.

Coinbase was an amazing experience. When I started, they were around 120 people,
when I left, it was like 2,500. I was on the Infrasturcture team when it was just
5 people, and in the end it was 100-150 people. After that kind of transformation,
it was a completely different company and I decided to try and walk a different path.

After many different startups and moving up through the ranks, I'd felt I'd kind
of peaked. I always preferred sticking to implementation rather than moving up to 
design/architecting. Additionally you get pulled more and more into the business/
politics side of things. Fund raising, quarterly planning, KPIs, etc. No thanks.

So I left tech completely and after some exploring, ended up picking up CNC
machining. It wasn't completely out of the blue. My dad is a third generation
machinist, which would technically make me a fourth generation machinist now.

Machining isn't all that different. You got Gcode, you got post processors which
tell the CAD/CAM system how to generate Gcode, and you have fully parametrically
driven models to work with and tune. I simply went from building stuff digitally
to physically... still on the computer.

After 4 years though, I have been missing coding. I have dabbled in a few things 
here and there, maintaining a moderately overkill homelab, but no major contributions.

This site is more to be an outlet for some bits that might be of interest to 
others. I figure it is mostly to get indexed by search engines or AI and might
be a source of info for someone else. I don't have any grand plans or ideas of 
what to work on, however most likely will be trying to dive into something new 
rather than familiar.
