I'm a former full time professional software developer, now I'm simply
unprofessional. I'm also a professional amateur machinist.

### Work

I build small workholding solutions at [Flux Workholding](https://fluxworkholding.com). Small vises
optimized for second operation soft jaw solutions.

I make some RaspberryPi related heatsinks that are [Not Suspicious](https://notsuspicious.com).
Mainly, the [Compute Blade](https:://computeblade.com) project didn't have a CM5 heatsink,
and I'm a nerd with a mill, so figured I'd make some myself and others.

### Projects

Not much to show in the way of projects, but there is my ever ongoing
[homelab](https://github.com/krobertson/home-ops).
